<h1>Design Problems and Future Considerations</h1>

<h3>Shape</h3>
<p>Our hovercraft is oval-shaped with a length to width ratio of 3:2. The first problem we encountered with this shape was that it was hard to evenly wrap our mylar around the soft corners. The mylar creased around the corners, and stuck out unevenly, often hanging down enough to provide friction for the hovercraft, creating a pivot point when we tried to move the hovercraft around. We had to make extra cuts, and then iron and glue the corners to prevent this. A hovercraft with sharper edges may take significantly less mylar tuning, and we haven't found speed to be a major issue, so  the fact that square edges may reduce the aerodynamics of the hovercraft may not be as significant an issue as we thought.</p>

<h3>Weight Distribution</h3>
<p>Our fan blows air parallel to the ground, and we have a Styrofoam encasing around the fan directing the air down into the hovercraft base, with a single hole at the bottom of the hovercraft in the center. As mentioned above, we tried to seal the mylar around the edges of the hovercraft so that it was air-tight. We cut a Styrofoam circle that had a diameter just slightly bigger than that of the fan, and placed it even with the edge of the fan, in order to get the maximum possible amount of air intake, and prevent as little air as possible from escaping. Our fan motor is large, and is able to easily lift our hovercraft, and with this design we haven't come across any lift-related issues. The main problem we encountered having a single large fan is that it is being held up by the small square Styrofoam encasing, under 20cm in length. The fan makes up a significant portion of the overall weight of our hovercraft, and the weight distribution is all in the very center of the hovercraft. Because a large amount of the weight is in the very center, our hovercraft can easily tip, allowing air to flow out from the bottom of one side, resulting in the hovercraft gliding across the floor, or spinning.</p>

<p>
If the hovercraft moves around at all when just the lift fan is on, then it is extremely hard to control with the joystick. We initially hoped we could counterbalance this with software code, and shifted the power of the control fans on the side of the hovercraft accordingly. This took a lot of fine-tuning, and the hovercraft still was extremely hard to control, as air always seemed to be leaking from a different side, depending on the hovercraft's current movement direction and the forces exerted by the fans. </p>

<p>
By placing weight around the edges of the hovercraft, we can greatly reduce the movement of the hovercraft when just the lift fan is on. The problem was that when enough weight was placed around the perimeter of the hovercraft that it remains motionless when the control fans are off, the fans had trouble moving the hovercraft forward or backward even at full power. As we took weight off, the motors could control the hovercraft more, but with less weight balancing the hovercraft, it again moves and spins uncontrollably.</p>

<h3>Next Prototype</h3>
<p>In our next prototype, we will try and spread out the weight distribution of our center fan. This will reduce the amount of weight needed to place around the perimeter to balance the hovercraft, so the motors will be powerful enough to move the hovercraft. Now that we have our wiring completed, and are sure of the number of batteries, chips, fans, and bread-boards we will use, we can also plan a new design that takes into consideration their weights as well. Our large lift fan has always easily lifted our hovercraft, but we have found that it drains batteries quickly, our next design will also be a smaller hovercraft size, and therefore we will also use a smaller lift fan.</p>
