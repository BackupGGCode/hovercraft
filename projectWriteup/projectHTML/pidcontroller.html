<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Upon completion of the vehicle body and electronic components, we ran into major weight balance issues. Since a hovercraft is practically floating on a thin layer of air, it is highly sensitive to weight imbalance. This imbalance causes the hovercraft to stray (yaw) off course, making it very difficult to control. Presented with such a situation, a PID controller can potentially correct the imbalance issues by having the hovercraft automatically compensate to the yaw produced by the imbalance. Please note that A PID controller is <b>NOT</b> implemented for this project.  The goal of this document is to provide a possible solution. </p>

<h1>PID Controller Primer</h1>
<p>PID in PID controller stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative. These three terms are used to define the behaviour of the controller.  Each of them contributes to the final output of the controller, and different weights can be assigned to different terms. The weights selection process (tuning) is not an easy task.  In a nutshell, a PID controller can output corrective actions based on the difference (error) between a set point (SP), the desired value, and a measured process variable (PV), the instantaneous value. A PID controller is a feedback control loop wherein the output of the controller is treated as an input of the same controller. The feedback allows the controller to intelligently <i>adjust</i> its output according to the error. </p>

<h5>Layout of a system using a PID controller.</h5>

<p>The object being controlled by the PID controller is usually referred as  the plant, as shown in the above diagram. Depending on the system, a plant can be a motor, servo, actuator, and etc. The plant is constantly monitored by some sensors in order for the PID controller to adjust its output based on the error.</p>

<h2>PID Terms</h2>
<p> As mentioned earlier, there are three terms that determine the behaviour of the PID controller. The calculated output or Manipulated Variable (MV) of the PID controller is the summation of all three terms. The formula can be written as: </p>

<img src="http://hovercraft.myavalon.ca/images/pid/pidmodelformula.png"/>

<p>where K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>, and K<sub>i</sub> are the weight constants or the tuning parameters, and <i>e</i> is the error calculated by subtracting the set point(SP) by the process variable(PV) or <i>SP - PV</i></p>

<h3>Proportional Term</h3>
<p>The proportional term in the PID controller corresponds to how fast the controller reacts to error. Depending on the parameter K<sub>p</sub>, the magnitude of the proportional term will either amplify or diminish in the presence of error. However, an improper choice of the K<sub>p</sub> can lead to the system become unstable, because when the value of K<sub>p</sub> is too large or too small, the output , MV(<i>t</i>), of the controller will overshoot or it will take a long time to reach the set point(SP), the desired value. </p>

<h3>Derivative Term</h3>
<p> The derivative term determines the rate of which the <i>e(t)</i> is changing with respect of time. The rate can be calculated by taking the first derivative of the error over time. For example, if the K<sub>d</sub> is set too high, which means the controller's output will converge to the set point very quickly, but it will run into the problem of overshooting. By adding the derivative term, the output of the controller can be slowed down as it gets closer and closer to the set point. In other words, the derivative term can minimize overshoot and slightly improve the converge time. One problem with the derivative term is that it is very sensitive to noise. For instance, if the error rate is changing constantly, but the sampling rate of the sensors is not constant, then this noise will inadvertently propagate to the output of the controller and possibly amplify by K<sub>d</sub>. </p>

<h3>Integral Term</h3>
    <p>
      Both the proportional term and derivative term deal with the convergent
      time(rise time) and the problem of overshooting. However, they don't
      take into account of whether the output of the plant is actually equal
      to the set point (steady state), and how to minimize the steady state
      error.  Integral term takes into account of the accumulated errors
      within a period of time. It ensures that the output of the plant has
      reached the set point and it will stay at the set point until a new set
      point is defined. Moreover, a small steady state error may not be
      noticeable by the proportional term until the error becomes very large.
      Hence, the integral can detect slight variation between the set point
      and output and make proper adjustments accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>Tuning</h2>
    <p>
      The values for K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>, and K<sub>i</sub> can
      greatly affect the performance of the PID controller. Moreover, the
      values for those constants must be tuned according to the system that
      employs the PID controller. There isn't a set of values that will work
      for multiple systems.
    </p>
    
    <h1>PID Controller and Hovercraft</h1>
    <p>
      The PID controller logic will be implemented in AT90USB. Since our
      design of the hovercraft uses two motors for thrust as well as for
      turning, the plants will be the two motors. The sensors will be
      described below. The following diagram describes how the plants, PID
      controller, and sensors interact. The connections connecting the two
      motors and the sensors are dotted because the sensors are not directly
      monitoring the RPM of the motors. The sensors are constantly monitoring
      the heading, yaw rate, and motions.
    </p>

    <h2>Sensors</h2>
    <p>
      Sensors are necessary to keep the hovercraft heading straight and steady
      and essential to the PID controller as they provide feedback
      information. In order to navigate the environment without running into
      obstacles, hovercraft will use sonars for ranging. A magnetometer to
      detect the heading of the hovercraft. A gyroscope to determine the
      angular momentum of the hovercraft, and accelerometers to detect
      accelerations.
    </p>

    <h3>Sonars</h3>
    <p>
      In autonomous mode, the hovercraft can rely on the sonars in front and
      on either sides to determine which direction to go. For example, it will
      always head towards the direction as the sonar that returns the highest
      range. Combining such simple heuristic and magnetometer can provide
      precise heading for the PID controller to steer and correct the
      hovercraft.
    </p>

    <h3>Magnetometer</h3>
    <p>
      The magnetometer is very crucial for both the hovercraft and the PID
      controller. It provides heading information of the hovercraft. Such
      information aid the PID controller in correcting the heading by
      adjusting the speed of the motors(plants) when the hovercraft is
      straying off course.
    </p>

    <h3>Gyroscopes and Accelerometers</h3>
    <p>
      Collectively an unit that consists of both gyroscopes and accelerometers
      is called an inertia measurement unit (IMU). The gyroscope provides the
      rate at which the hovercraft is rotating.  The angular velocity provided
      by the gyroscope is, in essence, the derivative term of the PID
      controller. Recall that the derivative term describes the rate of the
      change in the error. If the hovercraft is supposed to be going straight
      forward but it starts to yaw due to imbalance in the system, the
      gyroscope can provide the angular velocity of the yaw in an
      instantaneous time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accelerometers, on the other hand, ensures the hovercraft is in
      motion.  There can be a case where the PID controller is correcting the
      heading by varying the speed of the motors, but the combine of the
      motors is not enough to propel the hovercraft forward.

    The values, at first, oscillate for a few iterations, then they slowly
    converge to the set point value. Staring at the 50th iteration until the
    200th iteration, end of the <code>for</code> loop, the output of the
    controller stays at the set point value.  By tweaking the constant values
    for K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>, and K<sub>i</sub>, one can see how the
    output behaviour changes.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Please note that A PID controller is <b>NOT</b> yet implemented for this project.  The goal of this document is to provide a possible solution to our imbalance problems.  In recent testing we have determined that uneven weight distribution is not the sole contributor to the control difficulties we are facing. It turns out that the main fan feeding air into the plenum chamber is also a contributor.  At full power, this fan forces more air into the chamber, than when it's power source is partially drained.  We believe that a PID controller, finely tuned to address these issues will give us the control we need to maneuver the vehicle in close quarters. </p>
