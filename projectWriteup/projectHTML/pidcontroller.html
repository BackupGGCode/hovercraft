    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    For our hovercraft project, we ran into a major weight balance issues
    with the hovercraft. Since a hovercraft is practically floating on a layer
    of air, it is very sensitive to weight imbalance. The imbalance in our
    hovercraft that it will stray(yaw) off course and become very difficult to
    control. Presented with such a situation, a PID controller can potentially
    correct the imbalance issues by having the hovercraft automatically adjust
    to the yaw produced by the imbalance. Please note that A PID controller is
    <b>NOT</b> implemented for this project. This goal of this document is to
    provide a possible solution.

    <h1>PID Controller Primer</h1>
    PID in PID controller stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative.
    These three terms are used to define the behaviour of the controller. Each
    of them contributes to the final output of the controller, and different
    weights can be assigned to different terms. The weights selection process
    (tunning) is not an easy task. In a nutshell, a PID controller can output
    corrective actions based on the difference(error) between a set point
    (SP), the desired value, and a measured process variable (PV), the
    instantaneous value.
