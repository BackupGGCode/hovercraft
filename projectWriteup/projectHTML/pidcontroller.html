    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    For our hovercraft project, we ran into a major weight balance issues
    with the hovercraft. Since a hovercraft is practically floating on a layer
    of air, it is very sensitive to weight imbalance. The imbalance in our
    hovercraft that it will stray(yaw) off course and become very difficult to
    control. Presented with such a situation, a PID controller can potentially
    correct the imbalance issues by having the hovercraft automatically adjust
    to the yaw produced by the imbalance. Please note that A PID controller is
    <b>NOT</b> implemented for this project. This goal of this document is to
    provide a possible solution.

    <h1>PID Controller Primer</h1>
    <p>
      PID in PID controller stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative.
      These three terms are used to define the behaviour of the controller.
      Each of them contributes to the final output of the controller, and
      different weights can be assigned to different terms. The weights
      selection process (tunning) is not an easy task. In a nutshell, a PID
      controller can output corrective actions based on the difference(error)
      between a set point (SP), the desired value, and a measured process
      variable (PV), the instantaneous value. A PID controller is a feedback
      control loop wherein the output of the controller is treated as an input
      of the same controller. The feedback allows the controller to
      intelligently <i>adjust</i> its output according to the error.

    <p>
      The object being controlled by the PID controller is usually referred as
      the plant, as shown in above diagram. Depending on the system, a plant
      can be a motor, servo, actuator, and etc. The plant is constantly
      monitored by some sensors in order for the PID controller to adjust its
      output based on the error.
    </p>

    <h2>PID Terms</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, there are three terms that determine the behaviour
      of the PID controller. The calculated output or Manipulated Variable
      (MV) of the PID controller is the summation of all three terms. The
      formula can be written as:
    </p>
    <!--
      \begin{displaymath}
      MV(t) = K_pe(t) + K_d\frac{de}{dt}(t) + K_i\int\limits_{0}^{t} e\, dt
      \end{displaymath}
    -->

    where K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>, and K<sub>i</sub> are the weight
    constants or the tunning parameters, and <i>e</i> is the error calculated
    by subtracting the set point(SP) by the process variable(PV) or <i>SP -
      PV</i>
    
    <h3>Proportional Term</h3>
    <p>
      The proportional term in the PID controller corresponds to how fast the
      controller reacts to error. Depending on the parameter K<sub>p</sub>,
      the magnitude of the proportional term will either amplify or diminish
      in the presence of error. However, an improper choice of the
      K<sub>p</sub> can lead to the system become unstable, because when the
      value of K<sub>p</sub> is too large or too small, the output ,
      MV(<i>t</i>), of the controller will overshoot or it will take a long
      time to reach the set point(SP), the desired value.
    </p>

    <h3>Derivative Term</h3>
    <p>
      The derivative term determines the rate of which the <i>e(t)</i> is
      changing with respect of time. The rate can be calculated by taking the
      first derivative of the error over time. For example, if the
      K<sub>d</sub> is set too high, which means the controller's output will
      converge to the set point very quickly, but it will run into the problem
      of overshooting. By adding the derivative term, the output of the
      controller can be slowed down as it gets closer and closer to the set
      point. In other words, the derivative term can minimize overshoot and
      slightly improve the converge time. One problem with the derivative term
      is that it is very sensitive to noise. For instance, if the error rate
      is changing constantly, but the sampling rate of the sensors is not
      constant, then this noise will inadvertently propagate to the output of
      the controller and possibly amplify by K<sub>d</sub>.
    </p>

    <h3>Integral Term</h3>
    <p>
      Both the proportional term and derivative term deal with the convergent
      time(rise time) and the problem of overshooting. However, they don't
      take into account of whether the output of the plant is actually equal
      to the set point (steady state), and how to minimize the steady state
      error.  Integral term takes into account of the accumulated errors
      within a period of time. It ensures that the output of the plant has
      reached the set point and it will stay at the set point until a new set
      point is defined. Moreover, a small steady state error may not be
      noticeable by the proportional term until the error becomes very large.
      Hence, the integral can detect slight variation between the set point
      and output and make proper adjustments accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>Tunning</h2>
    <p>
      The values for K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>, and K<sub>i</sub> can
      greatly affect the performance of the PID controller. Moreover, the
      values for those constants must be tuned according to the system that
      employs the PID controller. There isn't a set of values that will work
      for multiple systems.
