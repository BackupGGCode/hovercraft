A challenge that we encountered was that we were not getting enough power to our thrust motors. This lack of thrust was making it nearly impossible to accelerate and turn. In the initial testing of the power of the motors, we connected the thrusting motors directly to the 7 volt power source. In this experiment, the craft moved forward at a very quick speed over both the lenolium and the carpet.

Once we had the forward motors connected through the h-brige, the craft hardly moved. The fans were moving very slowly and hardly disturbed any air. Our initial hypothesis was that there was not enough voltage being supplied to the h-bridge. To solve this problem we tried to connect extra batteries as the power source and monitor the voltage difference between the output pins on the h-brige. Regardless of the amount of voltage that we connected to the Vs pin on the h-bridge the motors were still spinning much too slowly to move the craft.

We then decided our problem is that L293D can only handle 1.5A max.  A higher amperage version was also made available to us, but this version of the h-bridge that we had was broken. Upon further research we found that we could 'piggy back' two h-bridges to increase the current made available to the motors.

Below is an image of the pin connections and theory.

JOYSTICK

We got a new joystick that had not been modified.  The original state of the joystick, was that it had three potentiometers. One was for the X  position of the joystick, another was for the Y position of the joystick and a third was for the position of a dial on the base of the joystick. These potentiometers were connected so that the amount of current was determined by the position of the joystick. 

A potentiometer is a resistor with three terminals, a ground, an input and an output(the wiper). There is a knob connected that can be spun. As the knob is turned, the voltage read by the middle pin will output a reading from ground (zero) to the value of the input (in our case VCC).

We decided to remove the potentiometer at the base of the joystick and simply control the craft with the X Y co-ordinants. We then were required to modify how the other two potentiometers were connected so that the amount of voltage was determined by the position of the joystick. To do this we grounded one side of the potentiometer, and connected power to the other. The middle connection was then connected through the serial port as output.

Once the casing was replaced on the joystick, the readings from the board, when the joystick was connected to 5 volts of regulated power, are displayed in the table below.
