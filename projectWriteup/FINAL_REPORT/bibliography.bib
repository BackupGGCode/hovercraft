	Abstract = {We consider the control of a hovercraft, having only two control inputs with three degrees of freedom. The model is obtained from equations of a simplified ship which is nonlinear and underactuated. Using a coordinate transformation the model is given by polynomial equations which describe its kinematics and dynamics. Two control laws are proposed. The first one controls the velocity of the hovercraft. The other one stabilizes both its position and the (underactuated) side velocity and provides global convergence to the origin. The convergence analysis is based on a Lyapunov approach},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT The wave drag of a Hovercraft is calculated as the horizontal force associated with a pressure distribution moving over the free water surface. A general formula is derived for the wave drag due to any pressure distribution moving over water of finite depth. This is then applied to rectangular and elliptical planform Hovercraft, and results are presented for a range of Froude numbers and water depths. },
