This is the third, and final milestone for the embedded systems project, centred around the design and construction of an autonomous hovercraft.  Milestone 1 dealt with the interfacing of the various electronic components to the Atmel AT90 microcontroller.  Milestone 2 saw the design and construction of the hovercraft, the addition of the electronic components to the vehicle, and an analysis of various physical parameters of the hovercraft system.  This milestone realizes the full objective of the project: to supply the hovercraft with intelligence such that it may navigate a given course without coming in contact with any obstacles along the way.  

The graduate level criteria adds yet another objective to this project: the communication and coordination between two hovercrafts.  Accordingly, a second hovercraft was designed, constructed and testes, all in a similar fashion to the first.  Software had to be fashioned to allow for inter-hovercraft communication over each vehicle's radio.  

This document describes, in detail, each of the prior two milestones, as well as the final product.
